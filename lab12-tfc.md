# Lab 12: Terraform Cloud
In this lab you will utilize the [Terraform Cloud Remote Backend](https://app.terraform.io/signup?utm_source=banner&utm_campaign=intro_tf_cloud_remote).

Duration: 10 minutes
- Task 1: Sign up for Terraform Cloud
- Task 2: Update your Terraform configuration to use the remote backend


## Task 1: Sign up for Terraform Cloud

### Step 12.1.1

Navigate to [the sign up page](https://app.terraform.io/signup?utm_source=banner&utm_campaign=intro_tf_cloud_remote) and create an account for Terraform Cloud.

Create an Organization. This can be any name you would like.

### Step 12.1.2

1. Perform a `terraform login` from your workstation

```bash
Terraform will request an API token for app.terraform.io using your browser.

If login is successful, Terraform will store the token in plain text in
the following file for use by subsequent commands:
    /home/student/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json

Do you want to proceed?
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

  Enter a value: 
```

2. Answer `yes` at the prompt and generate a TFC user token by following the URL provided and copy-paste it into the prompt.
```bash
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Open the following URL to access the tokens page for app.terraform.io:
    https://app.terraform.io/app/settings/tokens?source=terraform-login


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

3. If the token was entered succesfully you should see the following:

```bash

Retrieved token for user tfcuser


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                          -                                
                                          -----                           -
                                          ---------                      --
                                          ---------  -                -----
                                           ---------  ------        -------
                                             -------  ---------  ----------
                                                ----  ---------- ----------
                                                  --  ---------- ----------
   Welcome to Terraform Cloud!                     -  ---------- -------
                                                      ---  ----- ---
   Documentation: terraform.io/docs/cloud             --------   -
                                                      ----------
                                                      ----------
                                                       ---------
                                                           -----
                                                               -


   New to TFC? Follow these steps to instantly apply an example configuration:

   $ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/tfc-getting-started.git
   $ cd tfc-getting-started
   $ scripts/setup.sh

```

At this point, Terraform can use Terraform Cloud with any Terraform configuration that has enabled the remote backend.  If these steps worked correctly, skip the Alternative step below.

### Step 12.1.2 (Alternative)
**These steps do not need to be followed if you succesfully completed the `terraform login` portion above.  The `terraform login` process performs these steps on your behalf.**

Terraform's CLI needs credentials before it can access Terraform Cloud. Follow these steps to allow Terraform to access your organization.

1. Open your Terraform CLI config file in a text editor; create the file if it doesn't already exist. This file is located at `%APPDATA%\terraform.rc` on Windows systems, and `~/.terraformrc` on other systems.

2. Add the following credentials block to the config file:

```shell
credentials "app.terraform.io" {
     token = "REPLACE_ME"
   }
```

1. Leave your editor open.

1. In your web browser, go to the tokens section of your user settings. Open https://app.terraform.io/app/settings/tokens, or click the user icon in the upper right corner, click "User Settings", then click "Tokens" in the left sidebar.
1. Generate a new token by entering a description and clicking the "Generate token" button. The new token will appear in a text area below the description field.
1. Copy the token to the clipboard.
1. In your text editor, paste the real token into the token argument, replacing the REPLACE_ME placeholder. Save the CLI config file and close your editor.
At this point, Terraform can use Terraform Cloud with any Terraform configuration that has enabled the remote backend.



## Task 2: Update your remote backend in the your Terraform config

### Step 12.2.1

Navigate to `main.tf` where we created our resources for this training. Add the following to the beginning of the file:


```shell
terraform {
  backend "remote" {
    organization = "<ORGANIZATION NAME>"

    workspaces {
      name = "<WORKSPACE NAME>"
    }
  }
}
```

Replace the organization with the name you chose in the previous step.

The workspace name is arbitrary, since Terraform Cloud creates workspaces on demand; if a workspace with this name doesn't yet exist, it will be automatically created the next time you run terraform init for that configuration.

### Step 12.2.2

Run `terraform init`.

```shell
terraform init
Initializing modules...

Initializing the backend...
Do you want to copy existing state to the new backend?
  Pre-existing state was found while migrating the previous "local" backend to the
  newly configured "remote" backend. No existing state was found in the newly
  configured "remote" backend. Do you want to copy this state to the new "remote"
  backend? Enter "yes" to copy and "no" to start with an empty state.

  Enter a value: yes
  
Initializing modules...

Initializing the backend...

Successfully configured the backend "remote"! Terraform will automatically
use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.

Initializing provider plugins...
- Checking for available provider plugins...
- Downloading plugin for provider "aws" (terraform-providers/aws) 2.18.0...

The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration, so the latest version was installed.

To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking changes, it is recommended to add version = "..." constraints to the corresponding provider blocks in configuration, with the constraint strings suggested below.

* provider.aws: version = "~> 2.18"

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

### Step 12.2.3

Rename your `terraform.tfvars` file to `terraform.auto.tfvars`

Create a new tag and run `terraform apply` and go to the Workspace you created. You should see state information there.
